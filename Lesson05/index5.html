        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This is the place where I, the great Exodia, was banished about a million years ago by the three deities and my limbs were sealed and power was divided into them.
        <br>But those stupid deities couldn't ever defeat me, let alone kill me. I was a threat to their authority.
        <br>Now, my <b><em>revenge</em></b> will begin!!!</p>
